This api and webapp are built to learn and test development and networking of and between containers locally and in environments such as Azure. 
The only current functionality is a single GET-request from dockerApp to dockerApi, fetching and displaying the string "Hello World!". 
The README describes how to run the two applications composed together or as containers  on their own.
Running them as composed containers gives us a very smooth way of setting both their networking and environments during local development.

A few technical choices have been made during their development. 
I chose to work wholly within .Net because of available documentation, guides and personal habits. 
dockerApi uses the net7.0 sdk and aspnet7.0 as runtime.
dockerApp uses the net6.0 sdk and aspnet6.0 as runtime.

Each applications is hosted in it's own Azure Container App, with it's own scale rules and so on. 
I have set the dockerApi to a higher availability than dockerApp.
